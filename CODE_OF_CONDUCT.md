# 🤝 Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We want this to be a **welcoming, friendly place** for everyone — especially beginners who are just starting their cybersecurity journey.

We pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:
- Experience level (beginners are celebrated here!)
- Age
- Body size
- Disability
- Ethnicity
- Gender identity and expression
- Nationality
- Personal appearance
- Race
- Religion
- Sexual identity and orientation

## Our Standards

### ✅ Positive Behaviors

- **Being welcoming** to newcomers
- **Being patient** with questions (remember, you were a beginner once!)
- **Being respectful** of different viewpoints
- **Giving helpful feedback** kindly
- **Focusing on what's best** for the community
- **Showing empathy** toward others

### ❌ Unacceptable Behaviors

- Harassment, trolling, or personal attacks
- Sexualized language or imagery
- Publishing others' private information
- Making fun of beginners or their questions
- Any conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting

## 🎓 Special Note for Beginners

**Your questions are welcome here.**

There's no such thing as a "stupid question" in this community. We all started somewhere, and asking questions is how we learn.

If someone makes you feel bad for asking a question, please report it.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.0.
